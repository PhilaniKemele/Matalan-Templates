            <p1>DISPUTED DELIVERY</p1><br>
            <p2>Thank you for reaching out regarding your order. I'm sorry to hear that you haven't received it as yet. We want to ensure that we investigate this thoroughly and resolve the issue for you. <br><br>
            To assist the courier service in their investigation, we kindly request you to complete a 'Non-Receipt of Goods' disclaimer form. We've made it convenient for you by providing a download link: <a href="#">[https://ml.thcdn.com/design-assets/documents/matalan/Denial%20of%20Receipt.pdf].</a> <br><br>
            Once you have the form, you have two options for completing it: either print it out and sign it by hand or complete it electronically. Please ensure that you fill in the tracking number in the required field at the top of the form. Once you've filled it out, simply attach the completed form as a file through the message center by clicking on the "upload file" button and selecting your document. <br><br>
            Once we receive the completed form, we'll be able to escalate the issue with the courier service and provide you with an update on the investigation. Rest assured, we're committed to resolving this matter promptly. <br><br>
            If, by any chance, you have received your item since you initially contacted us, then there's no need to take any further action. However, if the item is still missing, we'll do everything we can to assist you.</p2><br>
