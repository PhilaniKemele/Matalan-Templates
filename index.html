            <p2> Thanks for getting in touch with us regarding your luggage warranty. We're here to provide you with peace of mind and outstanding support. <br>
				<br>
				Rest easy knowing that every item of luggage you purchase from us is backed by a comprehensive 10-year warranty. If any issues arise during this time, we'll promptly resolve them. For the first 12 months of your warranty, Matalan handles all claims. If you're still within this period, please return the product to Matalan with your proof of purchase. After the first 12 months, please contact 'IT Luggage' directly for warranty inquiries. You can reach them through their website at www.itluggage.co.uk or by emailing customerservice@itluggage.co.uk. <br>
				<br>
				To ensure a valid warranty claim, keep the warranty hangtag and retain the proof of purchase (receipt, invoice, or order confirmation). Non-wheeled items may have different warranty terms. <br>
